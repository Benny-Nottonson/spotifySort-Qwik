## About

This project is a new version of an old project that was originally coded in NextJS/ThreeJS. It has now been rewritten solely using the Qwik framework. The website provides a Python script that sorts Spotify albums by the color of their album art. It utilizes CCV's (Color Coherence Vectors), caching, and multithreading to achieve efficient sorting.

The original paper, "Comparing Images Using Color Coherence Vectors" by Greg Pass, Ramin Zabih, and Justin Miller, served as the basis for this project. It explores the use of color histograms and spatial information to compare images.

For more details about the project, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Benny-Nottonson/spotifySort-Qwik).
